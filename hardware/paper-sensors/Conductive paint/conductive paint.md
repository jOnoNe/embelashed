# **Paper Potentiometer:**
## **What does the sensor do?**
The ink is carbon based and conducts electricity when dry. The resistance varies depending on the length and thickness of the ink. It is widely used in the paper circuitry as it is low-cost and flexible. You can draw any shape with it or cut the shape out of paper painted with the ink.

## **How do you embed the sensor onto paper?**
You will need:
- Paper
- Scissors
- 6 strips of copper tape
- Copper pad
- Conductive ink and pre-painted paper
- Glue
- Resistor (resistance depends: resistor = (resistance of conductive ink strip)/2)
- Multimeter
- Split pin
- Soldering equipment
- Brush

*Before soldering arrange your componants to make sure that it all fits together. You can use a small bit of masking tape to hold the componants down while you solder.* 

**Suggested sequence for making**
- Cut a strip out of the conductive ink paper, and paste it on the paper using glue
- Stick the copper tape to the paper
- Paint conductive ink between copper tape and the conductive ink strip, then leave it to dry
- Use the multimeter to test the resistance of the full length of the conductive ink strip
- Use the required resistor value (half the total resistance)
- Solder componants
- Attach the object to the paper using a split pin  

> **Handy hint!**  
>Make folds in the copper tape to keep a continuous connection.

## **What kind of interactions or movement can you sense?**

Slipping, Spinning the objects...and more

> **Handy hint!**  
> For the consistency of the input signal, avoid folding or squeezing the conductive ink paper.
