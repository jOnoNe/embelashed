# **Velostat pressure sensor**
## **What does the sensor do?**
The black plastic sheet is pressure-sensitive conductive sheet, also known as Velostat. It can detect force pressed on its surface. The conductivity changes when the pressure on it changes. It is flexible and can be used in paper circuitry.

## **How do you embed the sensor onto paper?**
You'll need:

- Paper
- Square of Velostat that fits to the paper templates 
- 3 strips of copper tape
- 2 squares of copper pad
- Masking tape
- 1k ohm resistor
- Soldering equipment

_For this sensor there are three parts -the top, bottom, and the velostat "sandwich". Start by sticking the copper tape onto the paper. Before soldering arrange your components to make sure that it all fits together. You can use a small bit of masking tape to hold the components down while you solder._

_When you have your top and bottom ready, use the velostat as a sandwich and tape it using masking tape._  


>**Handy hint!**
>Pasting the masking tape around the sensor is not only fixing Velostat, but also secure the circuitry from short circuits. Attaching the two parts of circuit using the non-conductive tape will be more convenient for you to embed the sensor to your prototype.

## **What kind of interactions or movement can you sense?**
### 1. Movement  
You can sense pressing or pushing.

### 2. Cooperation
It is a pressure sensor so can sense contact between people.

### 3. Environment  
You could sense leaning or bumping against objects, sitting on a chair or all kinds of things!
