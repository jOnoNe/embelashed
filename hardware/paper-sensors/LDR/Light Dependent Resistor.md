# **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)**
## **What does the sensor do?**
The LDR can sense the change of the light. The conductivity changes when the amount of light on the surface changes. It is very sensitive and can detect your movement around the sensor.

## **How do you embed the sensor onto paper?**
You'll need:
- an LDR
- 3 strips of copper tape (two strips are the same length, another one is shorter)
- 4.6k ohm resistor (aka 4k6Î©)
- soldering equipment

*Start by sticking the copper tape onto the paper. Before soldering arrange your components to make sure that it all fits together. You can use a small bit of masking tape to hold the components down while you solder.*

## **What kind of interactions or movemnent can you sense?**
### 1. Environment
The brightness changes of the environment around the sensor.

>*Handy hint!*
>When embedding inside paper, use white and thin paper that allows light to go through. This would work well with the LDR, as Bela is able to get a larger range of values when the light changes.

### 2. Movement 
It can sense all kinds of movements such as hip twisting, handshaking, arm waving and more!

### 3. Distance
You can sense both distance between the body and the sensor or between the objects and the sensor.
