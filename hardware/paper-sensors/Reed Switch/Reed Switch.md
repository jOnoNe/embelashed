# **Reed Switch:**
## **What does the sensor do?**
Unlike the Velostat and Light dependent resistor that can generate continuous signal, the Reed switch acts more like a button, instead of switching on/off by physically pressing, the sensor can close the circuit when detecting a magnetic field
## **How do you embed the sensor onto paper?**  
You will need: 

- Paper
- A reed switch  
- 3 strips of copper tape  
- A 10k ohm resistor(aka 10kΩ)  
- Soldering enquipment

*Start by sticking the copper tape onto the paper. Before soldering arrange your componants to make sure that it all fits together. You can use a small bit of masking tape to hold the componants down while you solder.* 

**The reed switch is very fragile, be careful with it!**

## **What kind of interactions or movement can you sense?**
### 1. Environment  
The sensor can sense the magnetic field around it.

### 2. Movement  
Banding arms; walking…and more      

### 3. Distance    
By placing magnet to body/object, it can sense the distance to the body/object.

> **Handy hints!**  
> If the magnet has less magnetic force, the reed switch can be switched on in a very short distance. A stronger magnet can help you close the circuit in a relatively far distance.
