# **Piezo:**
## **What does the sensor do?**
The piezo can sense vibration, such as knocking or sound waves. It measures the vibration by converting it into electrical voltage. In some cases, this sensor can also be used as a small audio transducer.

## **How do you embed the sensor onto paper?**
You will need: 
- Paper
- piezo sensor   
- 2 strips of copper tape   
- 1 mega ohm resistor (aka 1mΩ)  
- soldering equipment

> **Handy hint!**  
>There are two wires connected with piezo, the black wire should be connected to the "ground", the red one should be connected to the "input".


*Start by sticking the copper tape onto the paper. Before soldering arrange your componants to make sure that it all fits together. You can use a small bit of masking tape to hold the componants down while you solder.* 


## **What kind of interactions or movement can you sense?**
**1. Environment**  
Piezos can sense when they are hit against objects.

**2. Movement**  
Knocking, shaking, flipping, tapping…and more!

> **Handy hint!**  
>If you feel the piezo is too sensitive to realise your intended interaction, replace the 1M ohm resistor with a lower resistor value such as 100K ohm resistor, the less resistance used in the circuit, the less sensitive your piezo will be.
